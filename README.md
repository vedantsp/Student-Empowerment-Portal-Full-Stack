Our Project the "Student Empowerment Portal" majoring in Full Stack Web Development, aims to create a virtual and versatile environment for the students who are looking for a secure bubble in the path of their career. It also works towards the dynamic and overall development of the student in every aspect. Nowadays, students are always getting exposed to a lot of work in the their day-to-day life which tends to develop a lot of confusion inside a student's mind which downgrades their self morale. In order to put an ease towards the situation we were inspired to develop this kind of project which focuses on a multi-web page approach , a series of web pages like the home page, which acts as an introduction to our website, a roadmap which helps students to choose a reliable career path along with this, we have included a  "LGBTQ+" social awareness tab as well as a Mental Health tab which provides a more diverse approach.
In addition to this, a significant Profile Page which itself is variable in major aspects which highlights a rating system depending upon the data entered by the user marking his/her achievements and skills in his career. A couple of career tabs
which focuses on providing the information about the how to proceed with relevance towards a chosen career path . While developing these website, we had to roll over the internet and scan through different original existing research papers The different web pages had different authentications and studies associated with it which eventually had become a challenge to integrate all of the web pages together. This process helped us in getting exposed to various skills and latest technologies in the full stack web development, this increased our experience putting together the various aspects in website development.
